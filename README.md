android-ot-framework
====================

__Oneteam Android Framework__ is founded due to the need for rapid development. Also the Framework
provides a standard working system through which user can develop the desired module of
application or complete application instead of developing lower level details. The Framework
separates business logic from user interface making the code cleaner and extensible. Using the
framework, the developers can devote more time in developing the software requirement, not in
preparing the environment and tools of application development. The Framework follows design
pattern which makes code clean and extensible for future purpose.

The framework is under construction and this is an __initial version__.
